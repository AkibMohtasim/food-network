      <h4>Steak</h4>
      <p>A steak is a meat generally sliced across the muscle fibers, potentially including a bone. It is normally grilled, though can also be pan-fried. It is often grilled in an attempt to replicate the flavor of steak cooked over the glowing coals of an open fire.</p>

      <h4>Moroccan Carrot Soup </h4>
      <p>This simple spiced carrot soup gets added crunch from toasted pumpkin seeds and a mellow flavor from a drizzle of creamy yogurt.</p>

      <h4>Summer Asian Slaw Salad</h4>
      <p>Make this salad for your next picnic, and it’ll be a guaranteed hit. A tahini miso dressing gives it a creamy umami coating, while peaches add juicy pops of sweetness. I finish it with toasted pepitas for crunch.</p>
